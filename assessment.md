# Symmetry Take Home Assignment

If you have come to this page, it means that you are participating in the Symmetry Engineering Interview Process. We are excited to have you participating. We wish you the best of luck as you pursue opportunities with our team.

The Symmetry take home assignment is an important part of our Interview process. We give candidates the ability to display their abilities in a low stress, work from home approach rather than a time-based experience in a Zoom room.

## Developer Projects

We have many different roles at Symmetry ranging from backend developer to machine learning to product designer. As such, we have different assignments for the different roles.

### Frontend Developers

Our project for frontend developers involves building a small, single web page application (SPA) using React. Your SPA should make use of the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) which is fully annotated [here](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). Essentially, we want you to build a small [Pokedex](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex) in which you can perform certain basic searching and rendering of the data. We are looking for clean, organized code and a crisp UI experience that would make any Product Designer proud of your skills.

We are big believers in testing and continuous integration. As such, we want you to add linting, unit tests and integration tests to a CI pipeline.

#### Project Requirements

- Built in React and TypeScript.
- Contain both Unit and Integration Tests.
- Has some form of CI/CD pipeline with linting, tests, and deployment.
- Write an informative and descriptive README explaining what you built, why you built it, how to set it up, and how to use it.

#### Bonus

- Build a GraphQL server using the REST Poke API.
- Any sort of implementation of Data Visualization.

#### High-Level User Stories to Cover

**User Story 1**: As a Pokemon fan, I would like to search a catalog of Pokemon characters (Pokedex) by their name or by some of the characters in their name in order to return one or more Pokemon and their trading card attributes.

**User Story 2**: As a Pokemon fan, I would like know how many (count) unique Pokemon are in the Pokedex, as well as unique Pokemon Types and Pokemon Species.

**User Story 3**: As a Pokemon fan, I would like to filter and narrow my search criteria based on Pokemon Type and Pokemon Species.

**User Story 4**: As a Pokemon fan, I would like to see pictures of the Pokemon characters with some identifying attributes (trading card information) about the creatures presented in the screen.

**User Story 5**: As a Pokemon fan, I would like to sort the order of the Pokemon characters based on one or more identifying attributes about the character.

## Preparing for your Symmetry interview

### What to Expect

The interview process at Symmetry is efficient and quick. It's intended to give candidates the chance to meet most of the team in a short window of time. Our goal is to give the candidate as much exposure to the people, process and product.

The process begins with an initial conversation with our head of company operations. This gives Symmetry the chance to learn about your interest in joining our team, as well for you to set your expectations on what you are looking for in a company, career and culture. This usually takes between 30-45 minutes. Candidates are encouraged to prepare a few questions you might want to know more about the company.

You will likely have a follow-up interview with the hiring leader to go into greater details about the opportunity. This interview will be part behavioral and part technical. This interview typically runs between 45 and 60 minutes. We recommend that you prepare a few questions about the team, process, technology and/or company.

The technical interview is scheduled after the hiring leader interview. Candidates will present a demo of the project above. The technical interview will involve members of our engineering team plus yourself. It typically takes 60 to 90 minutes. Similar to above, we love when candidates bring us questions.

The final discussion involves meeting one or both of our founders. We think it's very important for all members joining Symmetry to get a chance to meet our founders to learn why they started Symmetry. It will be a standard interview format. It may last 30 to 45 minutes. Candidates are encouraged to prepare questions they would like to ask either our CEO or CTO about the company and our future.

### How to Prepare

There's a bit of a theme in the section above. We really want candidates to learn as much as they can about our company and the space we are competing. Most importantly, we want candidates to prepare questions at all stages of interactions with our team at Symmetry. Each meeting with a Symmetry teammate is a chance to learn something that might not be known by reading our web site or watching a YouTube video of a presentation we might have given at a conference or show.
